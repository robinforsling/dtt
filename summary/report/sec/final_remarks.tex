\chapter{Final Remarks} \label{cha:final-remarks}

The main purpose with this report was to summarize the thesis \cite{Forsling2023Phd} with a particular focus on practical aspects. We have discussed: (i) the evaluation of track fusion design; and (ii) how to design the communication management in case of communication constraints.
